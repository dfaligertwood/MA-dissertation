> The Night was dark and silent; when ^[| Lycidas \\\< \newline And Corydon \\\> : A character, originally from Virgil's \textit{Eclogues}, who appears often in Pastoral literature.] \
> And ^[| Corydon : similarly from Virgil's _Eclogues_. It is a less common name, despite being a more major character in the _Eclogues_;], both faithful Shepherds met,  \
> As wont to meet each other; and watch their flocks,  \
> Which lay about them cluster’d: when an Angel  \
> From Heav’n descended on a Beam of Light  \
> Insufferably glorious: they stood  \
> Amaz’d: but he with this message chear’d them;  \
> While Symphonies resounded sweetly warbling,  \
> The Trump of God preluding to his Song.
