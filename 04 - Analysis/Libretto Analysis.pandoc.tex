The Night was dark and silent; when Lycidas \ledsidenote{\textit{Lycidas} is a character, originally from Virgil's \textit{Eclogues}, who appears often in Pastoral literature.}

And \edtext{Corydon}{\Afootnote{\textit{Corydon} is similarly from Virgil's \textit{Eclogues}. It is a less common name, despite being a more major character in the \textit{Eclogues};}}, both faithful Shepherds met, 

As wont to meet each other; and watch their flocks, 

Which lay about them cluster’d: when an Angel 

From Heav’n descended on a Beam of Light 

Insufferably glorious: they stood 

Amaz’d: but he with this message chear’d them; 

While Symphonies resounded sweetly warbling, 

The Trump of God preluding to his Song.
