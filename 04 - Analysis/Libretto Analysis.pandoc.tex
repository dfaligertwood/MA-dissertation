The Night was dark and silent; when Lycidas \ 
And Corydon, both faithful Shepherds met, \ 
As wont to meet each other; and watch their flocks, \ 
Which lay about them cluster’d: when an Angel \ 
From Heav’n descended on a Beam of Light \ 
Insufferably glorious: they stood \ 
Amaz’d: but he with this message chear’d them; \ 
While Symphonies resounded sweetly warbling, \ 
The Trump of God preluding to his Song. \
