> The Night was dark and silent; when Lycidas \ledsidenote{Lycidas and Corydon are stock classical characters.}

> And Corydon, both faithful Shepherds met, 

> As wont to meet each other; and watch their flocks, 

> Which lay about them cluster’d: when an Angel 

> From Heav’n descended on a Beam of Light 

> Insufferably glorious: they stood 

> Amaz’d: but he with this message chear’d them; 

> While Symphonies resounded sweetly warbling, 

> The Trump of God preluding to his Song.
