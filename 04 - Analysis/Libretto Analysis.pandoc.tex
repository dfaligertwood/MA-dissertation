The Night was dark and silent; when Lycidas \footnote{\textit{Lycidas} is a character, originally from Virgil's \textit{Eclogues}, who appears often in Pastoral literature.\footnote{blah}} \\
And \Anote{Corydon}{\textit{Corydon} is similarly from Virgil's \textit{Eclogues}. It is a less common name, despite being a more major character in the \textit{Eclogues};\footnote{blah2}}, both faithful Shepherds met,  \\
As wont to meet each other; and watch their flocks,  \\
Which lay about them cluster’d: when an Angel  \\
From Heav’n descended on a Beam of Light  \\
Insufferably glorious: they stood  \\
Amaz’d: but he with this message chear’d them;  \\
While Symphonies resounded sweetly warbling,  \\
The Trump of God preluding to his Song.
