> The Night was dark and silent; when ^[> Lycidas : A character, originally from Virgil's \textit{Eclogues}, who appears often in Pastoral literature.] \
> And ^[> Corydon: is similarly from Virgil's \textit{Eclogues}. It is a less common name, despite being a more major character in the \textit{Eclogues};], both faithful Shepherds met,  \
> As wont to meet each other; and watch their flocks,  \
> Which lay about them cluster’d: when an Angel  \
> From Heav’n descended on a Beam of Light  \
> Insufferably glorious: they stood  \
> Amaz’d: but he with this message chear’d them;  \
> While Symphonies resounded sweetly warbling,  \
> The Trump of God preluding to his Song.
