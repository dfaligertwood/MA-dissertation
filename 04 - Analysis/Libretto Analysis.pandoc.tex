The Night was dark and silent; when Lycidas \ledsidenote{Lycidas and Corydon are stock classical characters.}

\ledsidenote{Lycidas and Corydon are characters from Virgil's _Eclogues_.

And Corydon, both faithful Shepherds met, 

As wont to meet each other; and watch their flocks, 

Which lay about them cluster’d: when an Angel 

From Heav’n descended on a Beam of Light 

Insufferably glorious: they stood 

Amaz’d: but he with this message chear’d them; 

While Symphonies resounded sweetly warbling, 

The Trump of God preluding to his Song.
