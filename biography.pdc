Thomas Drake
============

Biography
---------

Thomas Drake was baptised in Leasingham, Co. Lincoln, on October 18th 1692, the 
son of Reverend Nathan Drake. He was born into the Drakes, an illustrious 
Yorkshire
family, who rose to prominence primarily due to their Royalist tendencies during
the English Civil War [@Poole_2004_i1230]. His father died when he was just 13
[@Hudleston_i1022], and it is unknown which of his relatives raised him from
this point. However, he became a chorister in the chapel of Magdalen College,
Oxford, in 1707 at the age of 16, followed by his brother Nathan in 1708, and
his youngest brother Samuel in 1714 [@Bloxam_1853_i1026].

He matriculated into Magdalen Hall in 1709, having been a chorister for two
years, before resigning his post as chorister in 1711 and becoming a *demy,*
[^1] of Magdalen College; he held this post for ten years, until 1721, and
received his [ba] in 1713 and his [ma] in 1716 [@Foster_1968_i1031]. As he was
ordained priest in York, he may have left as early as 1717, along with his
brother [@Bisset_2000_i1043]. It is clear that from 1712  he was regularly 
travelling up and down from Durham to Oxford, as can be attested by his regular 
use as a go-between for Marmaduke Fothergill, a non-juror living in Pontefract 
[@Drake_1788_i1056, p. 2:160], and Thomas Hearne, a non-juror, diarist and 
bookseller based in Oxford. [@Doble_1885_1921_i1034, p. 4:40, 47, 66, 303, 
5:73, 191, 210, 229-230]. The point at which Drake ceases to be mentioned as a 
go-between in the letters between Fothergill and Hearne would certainly 
correspond with Drake leaving Magdalen when he was ordained.

However, this seems unlikely, and it is probable that he was ordained priest in 
York due to an intention to minister in that diocese. Unfortunately, his 
ordination papers do not survive so it is impossible to investigate this. 
However, it is interesting that in spite of an extended career as a Demy of 
Magdalen, he did not ascend to a Fellowship, as was usual at the time. Rather, 
he resigned in 1721. 

[^1]: A scholar drawing half the wages of a Fellow. Up until 1850, it was usual
for Demys to ascend to a fellowship in order of seniority when one fell vacant. 

During this time, Drake had two poems published in University anthologies: the
first, six Sapphic stanzas in memory of Queen Anne [@University_1714_i979]; the
second, in an unknown form, although it may be a poor attempt at a Horatian Ode
[@University_1715_i989. My thanks to Mr. Justin Murray for his help in 
identifying the forms of this and the previous poem.]. Nonetheless, these were 
not minor publications,
although there were many contributors, but the public expression of the opinion
of Oxford students. That he was published in these anthologies shows that he
was, at the very least, associated with the literary students
[@Kirk_1948_i1260].

In addition, the poem in *Pietas…*, with its mention of ‘the royal stranger,’ 
[@University_1714_i979] may at first glance be indicative of a Non-Juror. 
Non-Jurors were those members of society who, although remaining Anglican, did 
not feel they could swear an oath of allegiance to the Hanoverian monarchs. 
However, this is not entirely accurate. The poem continues to describe the 
Royal Stranger as ‘A saint, not unequal to the Britons, who will sustain this 
country from ruin’ [@University_1714_i979]. This use of the double negative is 
the rhetorical ‘litotes,’ a classical method used to intensify compliments, and 
in this context the poem is decidedly complimentary of King George I.

It is possible that Drake toned down his rhetoric somewhat, given that the
anthology was dedicated to King George I. In particular, he is identified as
being a non-juror while curate of Witton Gilbert in [@Hutchinson_1823_i999],
although I have not been able to find any contemporaneous reference to this. As
noted above, being a non-juror would explain why he left Oxford without becoming
a Fellow. He graduated with an [ma] on the 23^rd^ June, 1716, on which occasion 
he would have been expected to swear the Oath of Allegiance. He would also have 
been expected to swear an oath at his ordination, in York, in 1717, although 
this was presided over by the notable Tory — and alleged Jacobite sympathiser — 
Archbishop of York, William Dawes [@Bisset_2000_i1043, p. 20; 
@Handley_2004_i1164].

However, his resignation from Magdalen College in 1721, noted above, coincides 
with the point when he would have been expected to become a Fellow of the 
college. It is possible that he developed Jacobite or non-juring sympathies 
during this period, and that he chose to resign his post rather than swear the 
Oath of Allegiance necessary to gain the fellowship; that he resigned the same 
year that one would expect him to become fellow certainly suggests this. 
However, it is equally possible that he resigned as he had become Rector of 
Norham.

As noted above, being a non-juror does not appear to have restricted Drake’s
career unduly. He was ordained Deacon at London in 1715 [@Anon_i1075], and was
appointed curate of Witton Gilbert, a small village in County Durham, in 1716.
Throughout this period, he appears to have held some connection to the Dean and
Chapter of Durham Cathedral, as he received payments towards the costs of his
[ba] and [ma] in 1714 and 1717 respectively [@Hudleston_i1022].

Drake finally settled as Vicar of Norham in 1720, where he stayed until his
death in 1747. During this period, it seems he composed some chants that were
copied into chant-books for St. Paul’s Cathedral [@Drake_i1265; @Drake_i1267].
However, it is on his time in Oxford that I would like to concentrate. I have
already mentioned several times that I believe *Messiah* was composed in Oxford,
and I should like to substantiate those statements in the following section.

Oxford
------

Thomas Drake’s career at Oxford began as a chorister at Magdalen in 1707. He was
joined there by his younger brother, Nathan Drake, in 1708, and they were both
residents of Magdalen College until at least 1717, at which point Nathan
received his [ma] from King’s College, Cambridge; Thomas was resident until 1721
at the latest [@Bloxam_1853_i1026].

As noted above, Drake wrote at least one Anglican chant, and is almost certainly
the copyist for [ms] [d1]. Because of this, it seems reasonable to assume that 
he would have taken part in the musical life of Oxford at the time. During this 
period, music in Oxford was a well-established part of student life 
[@Wollenberg_1981_i1086]. As well as the chapel-based music, which was 
considerable, the Music Society was particularly active and had a large number 
of notable musicians members. First, I will consider the musicians and demys of 
Magdalen College in and around this period, before turning to consider the 
Music Society. In addition, Drake’s status as a non-juror means that he would 
probably have moved in the same circles as other notable non-jurors of the day, 
including of course Charles Jennens, the librettist for Handel’s *Messiah,* but 
also including others such as Anthony Alsop.

While Drake was at Magdalen the organist was one Thomas Hecht. Hecht was the son
of Andrew Hecht, the organist of Lincoln Cathedral from 1663-93 [@Spink_i1251].
He succeeded to the post on the retirement of Daniel Purcell, the brother of
Henry Purcell, in 1695, and no records appear to survive of his career, only
some gossip regarding his propensity for women, and I am not aware of any music 
that has been attributed to him [@Bloxam_1857_i1211].

However, the College Organist immediately prior to Hecht, and still living 
while
Drake was in Oxford, was Daniel Purcell, the brother of Henry
Purcell. Although there is no evidence that Purcell returned to Oxford after
leaving to work in London, it would not be surprising if he sent music back to
friends who were still in Oxford, and Purcell was a well-known composer in his
own right, writing for both the church and the stage [@Fiske_1986_i1118]. Most
interestingly of all, Purcell was a member of the Oxford Music Club while he was
organist at Magdalen, and a contemporary of Anthony Alsop, the author of the
libretto for [ms] [e1]. 

Given that Purcell was also a close friend of Gottfried Finger, the noted 
Moravian musician and composer of Christmas Pastorellas [@Fiske_1986_i1118, p. 
8], and his ties to Oxford and others who remained there — in particular, 
Anthony Alsop — it would be interesting to see if there were any students of 
Purcell in Oxford. It certainly seems plausible that the Pastorella themes in 
this music may originate with the music of Finger and Purcell.

That said, the Music Society itself gives a rather more direct route towards the
themes we see in this piece. The Society of Drake’s day was the successor of two
earlier Societies: the Mermaid Club, and the weekly meetings of Henry Aldrich,
the Dean of Christ Church College. Anthony Alsop was a member of both these
societies, although he appears to have left at some point before 1712. In
addition, Alsop was well-known as a Jacobite from 1716 [@Money_1998_i986]. Given
the Royalist history of Drake’s family, and the identification of Drake as a
Non-Juror, along with the fact that Drake copied at least one musical work for
which Alsop was the librettist, it seems quite likely that the two men would
have known one another. This in turn suggests that Drake could have become
acquainted with the music of Alsop’s friends, including Daniel Purcell and Henry
Aldrich.

Henry Aldrich, the Dean of Christ-Church, died in 1710. However, during his
lifetime he composed prolifically for the Oxford Acts, among other venues. For
our purposes, the most important aspect of his musical output is his habit of
‘recomposing’ the music of Italian masters. This is particularly interesting 
because *Messiah* is based on the Corelli *Concerto Grosso: Fatto per la Notte 
di Natale.* It seems quite likely that the composer would have come into 
contact with his music, and may have been inspired by Aldrich’s music to base 
*Messiah* on the Corelli Concerto.

The link between all of these people and Thomas Drake is primarily through the 
Oxford Music Club. Given the shared themes and structure, it seems extremely 
plausible to suggest that *Messiah* is a product of the Oxford Music Club. In 
particular, Daniel Purcell released a collection of Italian-style cantatas 
based on English texts in 1713 [@Holman_i1167, §4]. Although the collection was 
not purchased by the Music Club until 1718 [@Crum_1974_i1107, p. **PAGENO**], 
it seems plausible to suggest that the composer of *Messiah* heard these 
Italian Cantatas, and resolved to composer a piece in that vein. Being aware of 
Aldrich’s prior compositions in the Italian style through the Oxford Music 
Club, he chose to base his composition on a current Italian master — Corelli. 
That he chose the *Concerto Grosso Op. 6 № 8* could well be temporal proximity 
as much as anything else: as noted above, the Concerto was not published in 
England until 1715.

However, the theme of *Messiah* is still rather unusual. As a Christmas piece 
in the Pastorella tradition, it is decidedly Catholic, and *not* what one would 
expect from Oxford.
