Introduction
============

Durham Cathedral [ms] [d1], containing the music to *Messiah â€” a Christ-Mass 
Song,* is extremely unusual. Quite apart from the fact that it probably 
predates the Handel *Messiah,* which makes it interesting in its own right, the 
music is particularly unusual. The piece is a cantata or oratorio, and takes as 
its theme the Nativity of Christ.
