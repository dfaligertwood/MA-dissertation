The Manuscript
==============

the music was written. However, before one can , this chapter will concentrate 
on the manuscript as an artifact, rather than as music. In this chapter, I will 
first give a detailed description of [ms] [d1], as well as comparing it to [ms] 
[e1], donated at the same time by Thomas Drake. As both of these [ms] appear to 
have been relatively new at the time of donation, and they have remained in the 
Cathedral Library ever since, they have a relatively short history; however, 
after describing these [ms], I will consider the question of who produced them. 
As seen in the literary review, there has been no scholarship on this question, 
and in the second section I will draw attention to new evidence suggesting that 
the copyist was the donor, Thomas Drake.

Having shown this, I will then continue in the next chapter to provide a 
biography of Thomas Drake, identifying probably points in his life when he 
would have been likely to copy this [ms]. First, however, I will turn to the 
manuscript.

Bibliographic information
-------------------------

In this section, the bibliographic information of [ms] [d1] and [ms] [e1] will 
be examined. First, a description will be given of the binding and writing, 
before a review of the contents.

Both [ms] are attractively bound in the same manner, although the front cover 
and one leaf has detached from the spine of [ms] [d1]. The bindings lack 
distinguishing marks and attributions. However, even if they had, an internal 
note in [ms] [d1] states that it --- and by extension, [ms] [e1] --- was 
re-bound in the 19^th^ century.

Table: \label{contents-of-ms} Contents of [ms] [d1] and [ms] [e1]

</div>

Both [ms] display a number of clear similarities, which can be seen by the 
description in Table \ref{contents-of-ms}. Most importantly, both [ms] appear 
to have been copied in the same hand, by a single individual. However, it is my 
belief --- which will be discussed in the final section of this chapter --- 
that the frontispieces were not illustrated by the copyist. Before we address 
the identity of the copyist and illustrator, first let us consider what 
information can be gleaned from the title pages of the texts. First, [ms] 
[d1]:

<div class="center">
MESSIAH. A [nl]
*Christ-Mass [nl] Song* [nl]
For [nl]
Voices [nl]
and [nl]
Instruments [nl]
</div>

As can be seen, the title page does not identify the copyist, composer, or 
librettist. However, an inscription at the top of the title page reads:

<div class="center">
"Dono Tho^s^ Drake A. M. Vicarij de Norham & hujus Ecclesia olim Minoris 
Canonici" \label{title-page-inscription}
</div>

That is, "Donated by Thomas Drake [ma], Vicar of Norham, and once minor canon 
of this Church." The title page for [ms] [e1] has a similar inscription 
[^b:1:f1], and appears as in Table \ref{ms-e1-title-transcription}. This has a 
clear attribution to Anthony Alsop, who undoubtedly wrote the text to [ms] 
[e1], a paraphrase of the Te Deum in Sapphic stanzas. [^b:1:f2] However, it is 
clear that the music is *not* attributed to Mr. Alsop.

[^b:1:f1]: "Liber Ecclesiae Cathedralis Duncton \newline ex Dono Tho Drake A. 
M. Vicary de Norham & hujus Ecclesiae olim Minoris Canonici"

	"Book of the Cathedral Church of Durham; \newline From the Donation of 
	Thomas Drake [ma], Vicar of Norham and formerly Minor Canon of this 
	Church."

[^b:1:f2]: The text appears in @Alsop_1752_i1058, p. 1-4

After the title pages, [ms] [d1] has a handwritten copy of the full text of the 
libretto, in a clear cursive hand. Interestingly, the pages of this copy are 
numbered in arabic numerals, but in a separate series to the music; that is, 
the libretto is numbered 1--8, while the music is numbered 1--100. This is 
surprising, as even then one would expect for there to be a unique sequence of 
arabic numerals throughout a book, and it may suggest that the libretto was 
written separately from the music and only later bound with it. However, the 
music is undoubtedly texted in the same hand as the libretto, as are all the 
instrument names and dynamics, so this seems unlikely.

Table: Transcription of the title page of [ms] [e1], together with translation. 
\label{ms-e1-title-transcription}

</div>

As we have seen, [ms] [d1] raises a number of questions regarding the identity 
of the composer and copyist, and there have been multiple attempts to explain 
its unusual status. In the next section, we will cover new evidence that Thomas 
Drake, the donor, is the copyist.

Copyist
-------

\label{copyist}

We know from the title-page attributions and from [sc]ms a.iv.32 [ec] that the 
donor was Thomas Drake, we cannot be certain that he was the composer 
[^b:3:f1]. However, it *is* possible to investigate if he is the copyist, if we 
can find a sample of music known to be written by him. Alternatively, a sample 
of handwriting would be sufficient to show that he copied the text of the [ms]. 
Given that *Messiah* does not appear to have been widely distributed, it is 
likely that the whole [ms] was copied by one individual, rather than separate 
individuals copying each line.

Such a sample of handwriting exists. Thomas Drake's eldest son, also Thomas 
Drake, followed his father into the clergy. He was educated at Corpus Christi 
College in Oxford University, and ordained as a Deacon and as a Priest at 
Durham Cathedral. Fortunately, his ordination papers survive. Among the papers 
for his ordination to the diaconate is a letter from the elder Thomas Drake to
the then Bishop of Durham, Edward Chandler [@Drake_1746_i1045].

This letter simply states that there was a position available for the younger 
Thomas Drake as a curate in the parish of Norham. Most importantly, however, 
the handwriting of Drake is clearly similar to that of the copyist, with both 
writing the letters 'd,' 'N' and 'F,' among others, in quite distinctive 
manners.

In addition to this, I should now like to turn to the question of the 
frontispiece. As noted in table \ref{contents-of-ms}[^b:3:f2], this 
frontispiece has a monogram, probably of the letters 'ND.' I will go into more 
detail about Thomas Drake's family tree in Chapter 4, but his father, brother, 
son, and nephew were all called Nathan Drake. Interestingly, his nephew was a 
noted painter, particularly well known for designing engravings. However, he 
was born in 1726, so would probably be too young to have painted the 
frontispiece [@Ingamells_2004_i1153]. Instead, it is more likely that the 
frontispiece was painted by Thomas Drake's brother, although I have not found 
any surviving paintings of his. 

[^b:3:f2]: On \autopageref*{contents-of-ms}.

These two facts give a strong case that the copyist of [ms] [d1] was Thomas 
Drake, together with his brother. If the Nanki copy is also by Drake, then 
together with [sc]a.iv.32 [ec] this would provide strong evidence that Drake 
was the composer. At this point, it seems most useful to give a biography of 
Thomas Drake and a description of his background.
