In this dissertation, I examine Durham Cathedral [ms] [d1], *Messiah â€” a 
Christ-Mass Song*. The work falls into two parts: A textual and musical 
analysis of the piece with regards to its theological background and use of 
musical language, and a review of the historical and musical background of the 
piece, together with a brief description of the textual content.
