Appendix: Musical Transcription
===============================

Editorial Guidelines
--------------------

Throughout this transcription, I have attempted to preserve a direct 
correspondence to the original source wherever possible. However, I have had to 
make decisions, which are noted below.

### Instrumentation

Throughout the source, instrumentation is often omitted. Where necessary, 
therefore, editorial instruments have been added in square brackets.

### Key Signatures, Clefs, Accidentals, and Notation

Modern clefs are used throughout the transcription, with the original clefs and 
key signatures being placed in incipits. Similarly, notation has been 
modernised where necessary without comment. Redundant accidentals have been 
omitted, again without comment. In the [ms], there are often redundant tied 
notes due to line breaks or page turns. These have been replaced by full length 
notes without comment.

### Bass Figuring

The bass figuring is largely clear and well-aligned. Where placement is 
unclear, the aligment has been corrected without comment.

### Ornaments, Dynamics, and Articulation

The source is heavily ornamented, and these ornaments have been preserved. Any 
editorial editions are in square brackets. Original dynamic markings are 
printed in their modern form, and where dynamics and tempo markings were 
conflated in the [ms], they have been separated and noted.
